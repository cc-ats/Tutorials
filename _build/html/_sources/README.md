# Macromolecular Modelling Tutorials

Fall 2022

A series of tutorials will be given to cover basic macromolecular modeling of biological systems.  The topics include (a) ligand docking with Chimera, (b) AlphaFold, RoseTTAFold, and OmegaFold  protein structure predictions, and (c) basic molecular dynamics simulations with Amber.  You will choose several protein systems of interest to explore.  No previous software/programming experience is required.
